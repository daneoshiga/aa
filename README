AA
==

Introduction
============

aa    = Main interface (aa start, aa post 'foo', aa stop)
aad   = Daemon started by aa (or could we use just threads from aa?)

Installing
==========

Put aa.py on your /usr/local/bin:

    $ sudo cp aa.py /usr/local/bin/aa

Or just create a link:

    $ sudo ln -s /path/to/aa.py /usr/local/bin/aa

Usage
=====

Now you can use:

    $ aa start                        ... start your session
    $ aa post foo                     ... post foo
    $ aa stop                         ... stop your session
    $ aa config <attribute> <value>   ... set your nickname
    $ aa status|st                    ... checks if daemon is running
    $ aa shout foo                    ... post foo and sends message to server

For now, just 'aa stop' will send your 'work log' to the server. You
